## Finding Tests
To compare my implementation of `markdownParse` and the provided implementation, I copied the folder that had all the tests into my directory. Similarly, I coped `script.sh` as well in order to run `time bash script.sh`. By running this in my implementation and the given implementation, I can compare the two to see how they differ.

Note: My version of `markdownParse` was created in conjunction with my lab group, notably Tyler and Diego.
